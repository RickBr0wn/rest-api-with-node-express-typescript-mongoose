# NodeJS Express Typescript API Boilerplate

Hello world! This repository is a boilerplate that gives you a basic example of creating a RESTful API in NodeJS, Express, Typescript. It contains:

- A basic boilerplate with a sample route and a controller.
- Includes files: `.prettierrc`, `.gitignore`, `.sample.env`, `tsconfig.json`.
- A bespoke logging utility to conveniently log all input/output from the server.

Feel free to fork this repository and code away.
